This is a modding CLI tool for GDScript / Godot.

1. Author prefers maximally decomposed code.
   If there are functions, with nested blocks, each block
   should be moved into its own function. This should be
   done even if the new function is only called once. It should
   be done recursively. The goal is to read short compositions
   of simple functions at all levels.

2. Strict typing is not optional.

3. Iterate until the task is complete.

4. ClassNames, fieldNames, functionNames, methodNames, parameter_name, local_var

5. Refrain from over-explaining, be as concise as possible except for when actively
   prompted for detail by the author.

6. Relative imports need the .js extension

7. 4 spaces, no semicolons, prefer const arrow functions
